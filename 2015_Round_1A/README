Important: C large only ran within 8 minutes if it was compiled to x64, not x86
Solution for B:
	T is the time, when the barber will serve you. R(i) is the rate of barber i, the number of
	customers' hair they can cut (in most cases not an integer). Sum the rate for each barber and
	divide the number customers before you minus the number of barbers with the sum of the rate.
	This gives a time that is close to T, but somewhat smaller. Iterate one by one till T is reached.

Solution for C:
	Iterate over all trees in the forest. Draw a line to each other trees and test, whether which side of the line has less trees. If on one side
	there is zero trees that means that the tree in question is on the edge. Otherwise the number tells how many trees need to be cut out, so the
	tree in question is on the edge.
	Complexity: O(n^3)
