Important: C large only ran within 8 minutes if it was compiled to x64, not x86
Solution for C:
	Iterate over all trees in the forest. Draw a line to each other trees and test, whether which side of the line has less trees. If on one side
	there is zero trees that means that the tree in question is on the edge. Otherwise the number tells how many trees need to be cut out, so the
	tree in question is on the edge.
	Complexity: O(n^3)
